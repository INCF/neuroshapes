# Data Model Specifications

## Overview

This section describes key scientific and technical activities and agents involved in the generation of 
various neuroscience data types (basic, computational and clinical neuroscience data). For each data types, the generation context is described by mean of a data provenance pattern which is implemented as a set of W3C SHACL based validatable schemas.
