# In Vitro Slice Neuron Morphology Reconstruction

## Use case

### Description

This specification describes metadata collected for morphology reconstructions from brain slices. Reconstruction of a neuron morphology from slice typically
follows the injection of a dye during a whole cell patch clamp recording. Some of the activities
and entities shown here are hence shared with the in vitro whole cell patch clamp recording. Metadata is collected on the subject used in the experiment, 
the slice containing the cell, the labeled cell and the reconstructed neuron morphology. The dye-filled neuron is most commonly visualized using a 
histological technique following the fixation of the brain tissue. The stained cells are annotated and then reconstructed.
Metadata from all these procedures is captured as well as the protocols used and the persons, software and organizations involved in each of the steps.
 
 
### Supported Data Queries

The following points describe an example subset of questions supported by the data provenance pattern:

* Retrieve morphology reconstructions from a given brain region.
* Retrieve pyramidal cell reconstructions.
* Retrieve morphology reconstructions from a specific experimenter.
* Retrieve morphology reconstructions from a subject of a given age and sex.
* Retrieve morphology reconstructions which were reconstructed in a given year
