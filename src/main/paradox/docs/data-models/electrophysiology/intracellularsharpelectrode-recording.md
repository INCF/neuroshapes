# In Vitro IntraCellular Sharp Electrode Recording

## Use case

### Description

This specification describes the metadata collected for in vitro intracellular electrophysiology recordings using  intracellular sharp electrodes
configuration. 
Metadata is collected on the subject used in the experiment, the slice, the cell 
which was recorded as well as the recording traces and protocols. Additionally, metadata for the brain slicing, the intracellular sharp electrodes and the stimulus (including protocols and agents) involved in the generation
of the recording traces are captured.

### Supported Data Queries

The following points describe an example subset of questions supported by the data provenance pattern:
 
* Retrieve all recording traces generated from rat somatosensory cortex using selected stimuli.
* Retrieve recording traces by recording day and experimenter.
* Retrieve all response traces from a specific recorded cell.
